## Architecture Decisions

### Repository Storage
- Repositories will be stored in S3 for persistence
- Active workspaces will run in Docker containers
- Working copies in containers will sync to S3 periodically
- Changes can be pushed back to GitHub on command

### Workspace Isolation
- Each workspace will run in its own Docker container
- Containers provide isolated development environments
- Containers enable terminal access for users
- Resource limits will be applied to containers for fair usage

### Collaboration Model
- Real-time synchronization of code edits
- Multiple users can edit the same file simultaneously
- Changes are broadcasted via WebSockets
- Conflict resolution using operational transformation

## Future Enhancements

- IDE integrations
- Custom environment templates
- Advanced permissions and role-based access
- Build and deployment pipelines
- Debugging tools
